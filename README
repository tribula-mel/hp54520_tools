HP545xx firmware toolset
************************

This is collection of tools for reverse engineering firmware images for
HP54520A, HP54522A, HP54540A and HP54542A oscilloscopes. The tools give
you possibility to extract ROM/SYSTEM images from the firmware images
that are as of this writing still available from Keysight web site.
Original firmware images are LIF images, so lifutils (written by Tony
Duell) are the first step for extracting the files from LIF images.
The lifutils can be found on Internet.
